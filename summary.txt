Project Title: Africa's Economic & Energy Landscape
By: Victor Ekikhalo
Dashboard Type: Analytical Summary of GDP and Oil Production in African Countries (2015–2023)
Tools Used: Python (for data sourcing and cleaning), Power BI (for dashboard visuals)

🔹 1. Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a visual and data-driven exploration of economic growth (GDP) and energy output (oil production) across African nations over a 10-year period. It aims to uncover correlations, highlight leaders and outliers, and provide actionable insights into how oil production impacts economic performance.

📊 Total GDP Snapshot
- Total GDP (All Years, All Countries): $23.17 trillion
- Average GDP (Per Country): $49.50 billion
- Countries Covered: 55
> This section sets the scene for the scale of Africa’s economic data and introduces a comparative layout of GDP across nations.

📈 GDP by Country & Year
- Visuals:
  - Bar charts comparing GDP per country
  - Line/area charts showing GDP evolution across years (2015–2023)
- Top Performers: Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco
- Interactive Filters: Year and Country selection slicers for dynamic analysis
> Enables users to analyze GDP trends per country and spot patterns of growth, stagnation, or fluctuation.

🛢️ Oil Production (BPD) by Country
- Visuals:
  - Bar chart of daily oil production (in barrels)
- Top Producers:
  - Nigeria – 13.59M bpd
  - Libya
  - Angola
  - Algeria
  - Others: Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Niger, Egypt, etc.
- Insight Text Block:
  - Nigeria produced 13.59M bpd, which is 6,695% higher than South Sudan (200k bpd)
  - Nigeria made up 23.89% of total oil production
> Focuses on oil as a critical resource and economic driver in Africa.

🔗 GDP vs Oil Production Relationship
- Visual: Combo chart mapping GDP vs Oil Production over time
- Purpose: To explore correlation between resource output and GDP growth
- Finding: While oil-rich nations often have higher GDPs, the correlation is not linear — suggesting influence of diversification, policy, and global markets.

💡 Key Dashboard Insights Page
- Highlights:
  - Total oil-producing countries analyzed: 13
  - Nigeria dominates both GDP and oil output in several years
  - Some oil-producing countries do not show equivalent GDP size
- Summary metrics presented with slicers for year and country for interactive drill-down

🔹 3. Filters & Interactivity
- Year Slicer: Select GDP and production metrics by year (2015–2023)
- Country Slicer: Filter by country for targeted exploration
- Dynamic visuals update in real-time when selections are changed

🔹 4. Observations & Takeaways
- GDP Leaders: Nigeria and South Africa maintained consistent GDP dominance.
- Oil Dependency: Not all high oil producers saw proportional economic growth, hinting at issues like governance, value chain weaknesses, or lack of diversification.
- Data Gaps: Some countries may have incomplete records, which may affect trend interpretations.

🔹 5. Conclusion
This dashboard tells a layered story: Africa is rich in resources, but economic prosperity depends on more than production volume. The analysis provides policymakers, analysts, and data enthusiasts a snapshot of the continent's performance through a lens of energy and economics.
